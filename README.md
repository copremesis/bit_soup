```bash
cd bitsoup 
```

```bash
python -mSimpleHTTPServer -m
```

Then _browser_ to ```http://localhost:8000```


There's one _ajax_ call to the resource or model for amenities which in this case is a static json
object:

__amenities.json__



the _base2_ & _base10_ columns are to denote the _representation_ of the numbers that _correspond_ to the 
_amenity_ as provided from the original *Model*

(you can turn them off my clicking the table headers)


so now you type in a _random_ number into _amenity flags_ on the upper right hand corner .. 

or click on any of the checkboxes .... 

this is esentially the interaction based on the model and the resulting value is the large number within the inputbox

each _Site_ will have a large number associated with it ... provided in my _next_ stub example ... 

but this _essentially_ denotes the interaction of filling out the page along with updating the _backend_ _Model_

you send that large number back and I'll store it in the _rails_ __model__.
